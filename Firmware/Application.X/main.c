/**
 * Main file for KTANE, containing main loop and MCU initialisation functions.
 *
 * Firmware is designed to be non blocking, there should be no loops to wait
 * for either time, or a register bit to clear/set. The PICs peripherals all
 * support interrupt driven operation.
 *
 * As a result, code tends to be split between an interrupt for handling things
 * that can be processed very quickly (such as incrementing a value, moving
 * along a buffer), and operations which can take a longer time, or can be
 * called by other features happen in a service loop. Service loops should
 * always endeavour to only perform actions if something has changed.
