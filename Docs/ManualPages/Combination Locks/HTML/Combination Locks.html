                <h2>On the Subject of Combination Locks</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">This looks like a combination lock. I thought I was disarming this bomb, not unlocking it.</p>

                <p>Like a typical combination lock, this requires 3 numbers to unlock.</p>
                
                <p>Turn the dial to the first number, push on the dial, turn to the second number and push the dial. Finally, turn it to the last number and push the dial. That will unlock it!
                    If sequential numbers in the code are the same, perform a full revolution back to the same number. </p>

                <b><u>Which direction to turn:</u></b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before turning the dial, each digit of the initial number displayed must be summed, if it can be evenly divided by three then the initial direction should be clockwise, otherwise anti-clockwise.</li>
                    <li>Each subsequent direction should alternate.</li>
                    <li>The dial must not be turned both directions, if a number is missed perform another revolution in the same direction.</li>
                </ul>
                <b><u>How to decode the combination:</u></b>
                <p>
                    Each number ranges from 0-19. Refer to the table to determine each number.
                </p>

                                <li>Add the first two digits of the two factor code together. If there is no two factor code, use the last digit of the serial number plus the number of solved modules.</li>
                                <li>If the result is over 19, keep subtracting 20 until the result is between 0-19.</li>
